# Latex215
This repository contains my LaTeX files.  Originally discovered through extra credit assignments for a discrete mathematics class, I eventually began to typeset for additional math classes I took, including Differential Equations and Data Analysis class, even though written solutions would have been accepted all the same.

My current resume is in the folder titled **Software Developer Resume**.  Feel free to take a look. :smiley:

Contains coursework from the following classes:
* CSE 215 - Foundations of Computer Science
* AMS 361 - Applied Calculus IV/Differential Equations
* AMS 261 - Applied Calculus III/Multivariable Calculus
* CSE 390 - Special Topics: Computational Finance (Theory Files)
