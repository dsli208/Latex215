\section{One particle travels along the path $p_{1}t = <2.666cos(6.405t + 5.149) + 4.430, 2.666sin(6.405t + 5.149) - 3.610, 11.18t + 6.633>$ and another along the path $p_2{t} = <1.084t + 3.125, 3.096t - 5.332, -2.925t + 4.377>$.  The paths intersect at two points, one of which is a collision.  Find the point where the particles collide and the other point where the paths intersect.}

\par\noindent\large Remember, intersection is at $p_{1}(t_{1}) = p_{2}(t_{2})$, while a collision is $p_{1}(t) = p_{2}(t)$
\par\noindent $p_{1}$ is a coil/helix/solenoid, whose axis parallel to the z-axis.  It's radius is $2.666$, and is centered around the point $(4.430, -3.610)$.  When viewed from the top (z) direction, it's a \textbf{circle}.  We can formulate the equation for our "circle" to be $(2.666)^{2} = (x - 4.43)^{2} + (y + 3.61)^{2}$ \vspace{0.25cm}

\par\noindent $p_{2}$ is a line, with direction vector $<1.084, 3.096, -2.925>$ and given point $(3.125, -5.332, 4.337)$.  Given this information, we can produce parametric equations $x = 3.125 + 1.084t$, $y = -5.332 + 3.096t$, and $z = 4.337 - 2.925t$.\vspace{0.25cm}

\par\noindent By solving for $t$ in one equation and plugging into the other (in this case for $x$ and $y$), we get that $y = 2.856x - 14.26$.  Plug this into the equation for $p_{1}$, and solving, we get $x = 2.951, x = 4.658$.  We can plug the respective values into our parametric equation for $x$, solving for $t$, where we get $t = -0.1603, t = 1.414$ respectively.  Plugging the respective values into the $z$ equation, we get $z = -4.846, z = 0.2406$ respectively.  To determine the collision point and the intersection point, plug the values of $t$ obtained and see which are equal.
